 Hi, I'm Alison Babeu, and this is my portfolio for CLS 161: Introduction to Digital Humanities (an awesome class I'm auditing so there may be only minimal content here!)
Here you may find a collection of some of the things I may do this semester. The items that I have posted on this portfolio can be grouped into several different categories:
- [Blog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link reading-blog.md %}) In these blog posts I reflect on several of the course readings.
- [Project evaluations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link dh-project-evaluations.md %}) As a way of expanding my understanding of digital humanities, I spent some time evaluating various DH projects.
- [Coding Exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link coding-exercises.md %}) Coding is fundamental to DH work. This category contains rudimentary exercises I completed on my coding journey.
- [Lessons]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link programming-historian-lessons.md %}) After I learned some Python basics, I completed a few lessons from the Programming Historian as a way of applying python skills to humanities related research questions.
- [Final project]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link final-project.md %}) Here is where I put everything I learned this semester into a final project.
